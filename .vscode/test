# 🛡️ RBAC & Automation System

This repository serves as a centralized hub for project management and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. It is integrated with a custom VS Code automation suite that allows for one-touch syncing and real-time permission management via the GitHub API.



## 🚀 System Features

- **Global Sync:** Instantly push updates from any local project folder to this repository.
- **Automated RBAC:** Manage team access (Admin, Developer, Tester) directly from the VS Code Command Palette.
- **Audit Logs:** View a live list of collaborators and their specific access levels using keyboard shortcuts.

## 🔑 Defined Roles & Permissions

The following RBAC structure is enforced within this system:

| Role | Permission Level | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin` | Full control: Can manage settings, delete the repo, and add/remove members. |
| **Developer** | `push` | Write access: Can push code, create branches, and manage pull requests. |
| **Reviewer** | `maintain` | Repository management: Can manage issues/PRs but cannot change security settings. |
| **Tester** | `pull` | Read-only access: Can view and pull code for testing purposes. |

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions for VS Code

To use the automation shortcuts, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).
- Run `gh auth login` in your terminal to authenticate.
- Ensure your local project is initialized with `git init`.

### 2. VS Code Configuration
Add the logic to your **User Tasks** (`tasks.json`) and **Keyboard Shortcuts** (`keybindings.json`) as detailed in the project documentation.

### 3. Shortcuts Reference
| Shortcut | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Alt + G` | **Global Sync** | Prompts for a commit message and pushes to GitHub. |
| `Alt + A` | **Add Member** | Prompts for a username and role to grant repository access. |
| `Alt + L` | **List Members** | Displays a live audit of all users and their roles in the terminal. |
| `Alt + R` | **Remove Member**| Instantly revokes a user's access to the repository. |
